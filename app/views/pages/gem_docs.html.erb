<p>
For gem publishers, you'll want to install the gemcutter gem to get started: <code>gem install gemcutter</code> Once the gem is installed, several new <code>gem</code> commands are available to you, and they are explained in detail below.
</p>
<p>
The Gemcutter gem requires at least RubyGems 1.3.3 in order to work. Please upgrade by running <code>gem update --system</code> if you haven't already!
</p>


<h4 id="push">gem push</h4>
<p>
Publish your gems to the world with one command. All that's required is your very own Gemcutter account. The first time you push, you'll be asked to log in, and then Gemcutter will save your API key to <code>~/.gem/credentials</code>. Once your gem is pushed, it is processed, indexed, and uploaded to Amazon S3 behind the scenes and should be available for download within moments.
<pre><code>$ gem push pkg/gemcutter-0.1.3.gem
