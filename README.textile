h1. gemcutter

Awesome RubyGem hosting.

h2. Purpose

* Provide a better API for dealing with gems
* Create more transparent and accessible project pages
* Enable the community to improve and enhance the site

h2. Concerns

These have been moved on to the "FAQ":http://gemcutter.org/pages/faq.

h2. Contributions

Gemcutter has a 'commit-bit' policy, much like the Rubinius project. Submit a patch that is accepted, and you'll get full commit access to the project. All you have to do is ask us on #gemcutter on Freenode or bug qrush in a message and he'll add you as a collaborator on the main repository. Feel free to fork the project though and have fun in your own sandbox.

If you're looking for things to hack on, please check GitHub Issues. If you've found bugs or have feature ideas don't be afraid to pipe up and ask the mailing list about them.

h2. Testing

Make sure you run @rake gemcutter:index:create@ before running the test suite, otherwise it might complain. Better solutions to this are more than welcome.

h2. License

Gemcutter uses the MIT license. Please check the LICENSE file for more details.
